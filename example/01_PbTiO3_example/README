Examples for ferroelectric PbTiO3
--------------------------------------------------
The goal of this example is to use WOOP to study the origin of this FE polarization.

PbTiO3 is a typical ferroelectric (FE) material which possess a spontaneous electrical polarization.
The spontaneous electrical polarization comes majorly from the displacement of the Ti atoms' movement
inside a oxygen octahedron.

According to "The Modern Theory of Polarization", we need the dipole moment of both FE and centro-symmetric phase.

The major part of the code are explained below:

1. DFT calculation to determine orbital contribution of valence band and conduction band.

2. Wanneir interpolation to get u matrix and r matrix:
	(1). Valence band                       --> Molecular orbital (MO)
	(2). Valence band and Conduction band   --> Atomic orbital    (AO)

3. Projecting MO to AO and get the projection coefficient.

4. Using coefficient and r matrix to get WOOP and WOPP.

5. Analyze results.
--------------------------------------------------
To run the examples, follow the instructions below.

1. Use .win files in CENT/wannier_data and FE/wannier_data to get u matrix. [ext is MO, val is AO]
	(1). Use DFT calculator such as VASP or QuantumEspresso to generate cell periodic part of the bloch wavefunction
	     You can find crystal geometry and kpoint sampling in .win file.
	(2). Use .win file to generate u matrix by Wannier90 package. 

2. Copy u matrix of AO/MO to WOOP folder as wannier_u_AO/MO.mat. Copy wannier90_r.dat to WOOP folder.

3. Go to WOOP folder in CENT and FE folder, use WOOPs tools to generate result.

Additional:
1. plot wanneir wavefunction and check if you can get the wannier plot in (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b918890h)
