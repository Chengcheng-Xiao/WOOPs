Examples for Nitrogen molecule
--------------------------------------------------
The goal of this example is to use WOOP to study the bonding constitution of Nitrogen molecule.

Bonding diagram:

    N atom |           -           |  N atom
           |          - -          |
   p ---   |  Ef  ============     |   --- p
           |           -           |
           |          - -          |

Nitrogen is an elemental molecule, this ensures the covalency of the bonding between Nitrogen atoms.
The hybridizing p orbital can be easily categorized into one sigma bond (px) and two pi bond (pz and py).

Here, utilizing the decomposition formula of WOOPs, we can easily see that the atomic contribution of p orbitals to
the bonding molecular orbitals are equally distributed. Thus, we can define the bond order as:
              C_pz_atom_1
BOND_ORDER= --------------
              C_pz_atom_1
If BOND_ORDER = 1, then we got a perfect covalent bond.
If BOND_ORDER = 0, then we got a perfect ionic bond.

To run the examples, follow the instructions below.

1. Use .win files in wannier_data to get u matrix.
	(1). Use DFT calculator such as VASP or QuantumEspresso to generate cell periodic part of the bloch wavefunction.
	     You can find crystal geometry and kpoint sampling in .win file.
	(2). Use .win file to generate u matrix by Wannier90 package.

2. Copy u matrix of AO/MO to WOOP folder as wannier_u_AO/MO.mat. Copy wannier90_r.dat in AO folder to WOOP folder.

3. run WOOPs using input.woops provided.
